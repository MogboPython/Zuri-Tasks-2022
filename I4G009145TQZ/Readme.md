# Django Models #
* This is my submision for the assignment on creating Django Models. *

These are the steps I followed:
- I created a project using 
`django-admin startproject I4G009145TQZ`
- Then I created an app call _blog_ using
`python manage.py startapp blog`
- After creating a urls.py file in the blog folder and adding it to the main project's urls.py file. I focused on the models.py file and wrote my models.
- Finally I ran 
`python manage.py makemigrations` 
and then
`python manage.py migrate`
To effect my changes and create the database.
